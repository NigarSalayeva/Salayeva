      <h2>Hour of Code Project</h2>
      <p>The Hour of Code is a one-hour introduction to computer science, designed to demystify "coding", to show that anybody can learn the basics, and to broaden participation in the field of computer science. The Hour of Code takes place each year during Computer Science Education Week. It is 7-13 December in 2020. As students of ADA University, we -  Nigar Salayeva, Murad Nurullayev, Md Fahim and Narmin Taghiyeva also joined this project. We express our deep gratitude to Sevinj Mustafayeva, the director of Secondary School No.123 named after Haji Zeynalabdin Tagiyev, and the 8th grade students of the school for joining our project.</p>

      <h2>Website Project</h2>
      <p>The Website Project, which you are viewing right now, is a very interactive and engaging one.After completing CodeAcademy 28-hour course, we felt prepared to finally build our own webpage. It includes skills from HTML( hypertext markup language)&CSS(cascading style sheets) and JavaScript languages, which, if correctly applied, can create a real existing webpage.Only month ago, those words were nothing more than a theory, but thanks to that task together we realized what we are going to deal with in our future careers.</p>

      <h2>Robotics Project</h2>
      <p>Today robots help us a lot to do many programed processes. Our upcoming project is also about robots. Most of us probably played with logo toys at least one time. Our project is also like playing with these toys. We should come together with our group mates and write a program for a lego robot. We are so excited about this project and it will be great work for us!</p>
